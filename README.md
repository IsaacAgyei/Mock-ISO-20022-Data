# Mock ISO 20022 Data Generator API

This application serves as a valuable tool for developers requiring sample ISO 20022 data. It offers a straightforward API to programmatically generate realistic ISO 20022 messages in both JSON and XML formats.

**Currently, the API supports the generation of pacs.002.001.12 messages.**
